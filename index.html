            <h2 class="leading-relaxed">I am writing to express my interest in the Senior UI-UX Designer position at
                Orbix Studio. With nearly three years of hands-on experience in UI/UX design, coupled with a strong
                foundation in computer science, I believe I am well-equipped to contribute to your teamâ€™s success.</h2>

            <h2 class="leading-relaxed pt-10">Currently, I am employed at Kite Games Studio Limited, where I have had
                the privilege of being the lead designer for four mobile applications, all of which are successfully
                published on both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. My work has consistently garnered
                positive feedback, and these applications continue to perform well in their respective markets. In
                addition to my app design experience, I have also contributed to the successful launch of an
                SEO-optimized website, further demonstrating my versatility as a designer.</h2>

            <h2 class="leading-relaxed pt-10">My technical background as a Computer Science Engineer provides me with a
                unique perspective on the practical implementation of UX principles. This enables me to design with both
                user experience and technical feasibility in mind, ensuring a seamless integration of design and
                functionality.</h2>

            <h2 class="leading-relaxed pt-10">I am proficient in English,(IELTS-7.0) which allows me to communicate
                effectively within diverse teams. I am a strong team player, and my collaborative nature helps me work
                well with developers, project managers, and other stakeholders. My continuous desire to learn more about
                user principles and my excitement for new challenges drive me to push the boundaries of what I can
                achieve in UX design.</h2>

            <h2 class="leading-relaxed pt-10">I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join Orbix and contribute to
                your innovative projects. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences
                align with your needs.</h2>

            <div class="*:pb-2 pt-10">
                <h2>Thank you for your time and consideration.</h2>
                <p>Sincerely, </p>
